# Microsoft Build 2022 Top 10 Things For ANZ Developers

Content for the "Top 10 Things for ANZ Developers" event covering Microsoft Build 2022. 

If you would like to run your own event you can find the content below.

We loved the infographic below which summarises what the event covers. There is a [high-resolution version](infographic-blackboard.jpg) in this repo that you can use for your event. We would ask you not to reproduce outside of running your event.

The links for the [demo videos](./DemosVideos/readme.md) and the [presentations](./Presentations/readme.md) are now available. We'll add the recordings of the sessions delivered by ANZ speakers on 2nd June once they are available.
