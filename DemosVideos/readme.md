# Microsoft Build 2022 Top 10 Things For ANZ Developers

## Demonstration Videos

The video files linked from this readme fit into specific locations with the presentations. We've split them out to keep the PowerPoint file sizes down.

Due to GitHub's 100MB file limit we've pushed the videos to [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ajh6aqc-UljkeuWRPMqNmeR-Fxk?e=cn1ZNx) so you can download them from there.

The files are numbered according to their location within the overall run of the show. If you don't present all content, check the speaker notes in the slides you are using to make sure you use the right video.

All demonstrations have been pre-recorded and edited for brevity. You should find a speaker track for each video embedded in the PowerPoint slide that corresponds to the video. Where a video was originally part of a Microsoft Build 2022 session, a link to that session is included in the slides and it is recommended you watch the original session to understand the context of the demonstration.

Some videos have audio that you can mute when using for presenting. You may, however, want to listen to the track first for tips on what the demo is showing. We recommend the following two videos are played with their audio track:

- 04-02 - Low Code - Express Design
- 05-01 - Project Volterra
